Scenario
  - Client is a up and coming leader in the development and deployment of Tech-based Solutions. Client wants to deploy their Identity Theft & Fraud prevention product in the cloud.

Break down the GOAL into smaller tasks.

Approach:
  
  1. Check for any existing licenses between Microsoft and client
      - If there are any existing licenses, check for Azure Microsoft benefit
  
  2. Who will be accessing the product? 
    - Employees? (*Setup Azure AD*)
    - External partners? (*Setup Azure AD B2B*)
    - Does the client need to manage customer accounts? (*Setup Azure AD B2C*)
      - After choosing the correct capabilities, setup up groups and roles required by the client.
        - How many roles does the client need?
        - Can the roles be put into groups?
        - Ensure clear communication between client and the teams to ensure the right roles are assigned.
  
  3. Setup Access Reviews
    - Show client the recommended Access Solutions by Azure
  
  4. Create periodic backups to ensure information is retained in a Identity theft scenario.
    -	Setup Blob storage with periodic backups to store log files
