Scenario:
  - Client wants to build and deploy a video streaming App, similar to Youtube on the cloud. The App should stream videos and scale massively with high security.
 
Approach:
 
 1 Choose an Azure Compute resource
  - VMs? (Any speacialization?)
  - AppServices?
  - Containers?

 2 Choose the correct storage solution.
  - Storage account to store the videos
    - Blob seems to be the best for video streaming services
    - For availability, choose the correct data redundancy (LRS/GRS etc)
 
 3 Choose the right security plan
  - Security provided by Microsoft Azure itself
  - Ask the client how do they want to access the applications?
  - VPNs? Vnet Peering? ExpressRoute?
  - Configure WAFs
  
 4 Configure dynamic Load Balancing
  - Configure client-approved upscale/downscale conditions
  - Use Azure Appservice plans
  
 5 Configure SendGrid to handle the email solution
 
 6 Configure a monitoring solution 
  - Az Montitor?
  - Az Advisor could also help
